                    INSTRUCTION
                        FOR
     FAST TTF-FONT INSTALLATION UNDER PDF(LA)TEX

0. See
   https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/196014/error-after-installing-font-using-otftotfm-unknown-version-of-os-2-table-000
   The site
   http://litwr2.atspace.eu/tex.html
   contains link to Cyberbas font used as an example in the below text.

1. Run shell script (it uses `sed' and `rm' standard Unix/Linux/... commands)
     ttfencinst.sh FONTFILENAME ENCODING [NO UNICODE FLAG]
   e.g.,
     ttfencinst.sh Cyberbas t2c no
   or just
     ttfencinst.sh Cyberbas t2c
   Under Microsoft Windows you may use direct call for `bash', e.g.,
     bash ttfencinst.sh Cyberbas t2c
   or
     bash ttfencinst.sh Cyberbas t2c no
   Linux/Unix/... utilities for Microsoft Windows may be taken from
   http://www.delorie.com

   The third parameter (any text string) may be omitted. If it presents
   then `ttf2afm' produces the glyph names instead of their unicodes. This
   makes font map more readable but may produce problems with some rare fonts.

   The following ligatures are set automatically ?`, !`, --, ---, ``, '', ff,
   fi, fl, ffi, ffl, <<, and >>.

2. See FONTFILENAME-ENCODING.pdf (e.g., Cyberbas-t2c.pdf)

3. Move .enc, .tfm, .ttf files to the TeX directories (these files names
     should be like Cyberbas-t2c.enc, Cyberbas-t2c.tfm, Cyberbas.ttf). The
     current directory may be used too -- This is convenient for the font test
     purpose.

4. Add .4map (e.g., Cyberbas-t2c.4map) file to pdftex.map file (this maybe
     also done by modifying of updmap.cfg and running `updmap' program).
     Instead of this you may add line
\pdfmapline{+FONTFILENAME-ENCODING <FONTFILENAME-ENCODING.enc <FONTFILENAME.ttf}
     to the preamble of your document. This line may be like that
\pdfmapline{+Cyberbas-t2c <Cyberbas-t2c.enc <Cyberbas.ttf}
     The argument for \pdfmapline is the contents of .4map file.

5. You may repeat this process for creating .enc and .tfm files for other
     encodings.

6. Run something appropriate (e.g., mktexlsr) to update TeX files database.
     This step is redundant in the case of using of the current directory.

These steps will allow to attach new font to LaTeX by command
\newfont{\FONTID}{FONTFILENAME-ENCODING [at SIZE]}
     For example, 
\newfont{\CyberTtwoC}{Cyberbas-T2C at 10pt}

\FONTID will switch to a new font and allow to use numeric indices to its
glyphs (at \char or \symbol commands) as well as standard TeX names like
\copyright, \CYRA, \CYRYAT, etc. Don't forget to set the proper encoding by
\fontencoding{ENCODING}\selectfont in the case of document with multiple
encodings for fonts.

It is possible to create a new font family (series, etc) for new font(s). This
will require to create a `.fd' file. A sample of this file is provided.
This .fd file must also be placed to the TeX directory.

For example, t2ccyber.fd file will introduce `cyber' family of t2c encoded
fonts.

The LaTeX commands sequence \fontfamily{cyber}\selectfont will attach the
font.

You may also install all glyphs of any ttf-font by `ttfallinst.sh' script.
Run
     ttfallinst.sh FONTFILENAME
e.g.,
     ttfallinst.sh Cyberbas

This will produce a set of .enc, .vpl and .tfm files which names are
FONTFILENAME-all#, e.g., Cyberbas-all0 or Cyberbas-all4. This will also
produce .tex and .pdf files with name FONTFILENAME-all-dump, e.g.,
Cyberbas-all-dump. The .pdf file will contain all glyphs of the font in the
consequent tables, one table per appropriate .enc/.tfm file pair.

You should move all .enc, .tfm, and .ttf files to TeX directories and install
them as shown above. Don't forget to use .4map file directly or by using of
\pdfmapline command. You can also install only those .enc/.tfm files pairs
that contain necessary glyphs.

There is generally no convenient way to use the installed fonts with all
glyphs support. You should probably use direct access to the glyphs via
\symbol or \char commands. The hardcopy of FONTFILENAME-all-dump file may
be very useful in this case.

The files with `vpl' and `afm' extensions aren't required for the work
with TeX and may be deleted.
